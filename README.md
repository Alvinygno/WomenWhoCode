## WomenWhoCode
CodePath group project. Bring the WWCode experience mobile. 

**Problem/Opportunity:** Currently, our reach happens through expanding networks 
and our weekly Code Review. We want to be able to reach an engineer even if we 
donâ€™t have a network in their area, more directly, and make it so they feel like 
they are apart of WWCode regardless of where they are in the world. Our goal is 
to reach 1 million engineers.  

**Product Overview:** This experience will leverage existing internal data: 
WWCode events, event streaming, resources, internal blogs, job posts, inbound 
conference data. We will also provide the ability to connect with other like 
minded engineers through in app direct messaging and event driven groups. 

We are going to find out what interests our members based on a personalization 
flow in order to feed them proper data and connect them with like minded members 
in their area and around the world. This is creating a more immediate, and 
direct way to connect regardless of where you are located.
